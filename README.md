# Data-Science-practice
This repositories consist of some exercises that I have done, especially those for data science job interview. They are not perfect, but it shows my effort and if you happen to bump into it, please comment if you have better ideas to improve them. Of course, I have also done a lot of class exercise on Coursera online course, but they are bitesize, so might not worth sharing yet
